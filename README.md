#Genetic Drift in Conifers#

A fantasy built upon another fantasy, that of drawing pictures of conifers based on a set of "genes" that can be "mutated". This was inspired by Richard Dawkins's program from long ago.

This project was cloned from the angular-seed repository on github.

It's a learning exercise: implement a single-page app with AngularJS on the client, Snap (Haskell web framework) on the server (the `conifer-server` repository), and the `individual` example from the `conifer` repository to create images to display.
